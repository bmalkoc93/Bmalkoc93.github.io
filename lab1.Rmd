You will be using R to complete all data analysis tasks in this class.  For those who have never used R or it has been a long time since you've used the program, welcome to what will be a life fulfilling journey! 

The objectives of the guide are as follows

1. Install and set up R and RStudio. 
2. Understand R data types
3. Understand R data structures
4. Understand R functions 
5. Understand R Markdown 

This lab guide follows closely and supplements the material presented in Chapters 2, 4, 7 and 21 in the textbook [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) (RDS).

## **What is R?**
\

R is a free, open source statistical programming language.  It is useful for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. R is an interpreted language, not a compiled one. This means that you type something into R and it does what you tell it.  It is both a command line software and a programming environment.  It is an extensible, open-source language and computing environment for Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, and Linux platforms, which  allows for the user to freely distribute, study, change, and improve the software. It is basically a free, super big, and complex calculator. You will be using R to accomplish all data analysis tasks in this class. You might be wondering "Why in the world do we need to know how to use a statistical software program?" Here are the main reasons:

<br>

1. You will be learning about abstract concepts in lecture and the readings.  Applying these concepts using real data is an important form of learning.  A statistical software program is the most efficient (and in many cases the only) means of running data analyses, not just in the cloistered setting of a university classroom, but especially in the real world.  Applied data analysis will be the way we bridge statistical theory to the "real world." And R is the vehicle for accomplishing this.

2. In order to do applied data analysis outside of the classroom, you need to know how to use a statistical program. There is no way around it as we don't live in an exclusively pen and paper world.  If you want to collect data on soil health, you need a program to store and analyze that data. If you want to collect data on the characteristics of recent migrants, you need a program to store and analyze that data.

<br>

The next question you may have is "I love Excel [or insert your favorite program]. Why can't I use that and forget your stupid R?" Here are some reasons

<br>

1. it is free. Most programs are not; 
2. it is open source. Which means the software is community supported.  This allows you to get help not from some big corporation (e.g.  Microsoft with Excel), but people all around the world who are using R.  And R has **a lot** of users, which means that if you have a problem, and you pose it to the user community, someone will help you;
3. it is powerful and extensible (meaning that procedures for analyzing data that don’t currently exist can be readily developed);
4. it has the capability for mapping data, an asset not generally available in other statistical software;
5. If it isn't already there, R is becoming the de-facto data analysis tool in the social sciences

<br>

R is different from Excel in that it is generally not a point-and-click program.  You will be primarily writing code to clean and analyze data.  What does *writing* or *sourcing* code mean? A basic example will help clarify.  Let's say you are given a dataset with 10 rows representing people living in Davis, CA. You have a variable in the dataset representing individual income.  Let's say this variable is named *inc*.  To get the mean income of the 10 people in your dataset, you would write code that would look something like this


```r
mean(inc)
```

The command tells the program to get the mean of the variable *inc*.  If you wanted the sum, you write the command `sum(inc)`. 

Now, where do you write this command? You write it in a script.  A script is basically a text file.  Think of writing code as something similar to writing an essay in a word document. Instead of sentences to produce an essay, in  a programming script you are writing code to run a data analysis.  We'll go through scripting in more detail later in this lab, but the basic process of sourcing code to run a data analysis task is as follows. 

1. **Write code**. First, you open your script file, and write code or various commands (like `mean(inc)`) that will execute data analysis tasks in this file.
2. **Send code to the software program**. You then send some or all of your commands to the statistical software program (R in our case).
3. **Program produces results based on code**. The program then reads in your commands from the file and executes them, spitting out results in its console screen. 
 
I am skipping over many details, most of which are dependent on the type of statistical software program you are using, but the above steps outline the general work flow. You might now be thinking that you're perfectly happy pointing and clicking your mouse in Excel (or wherever) to do your data analysis tasks.  So, why should you adopt the statistical programming approach to conducting a data analysis? 

<br>

1. Your script  documents the decisions you made during the data analysis process. This is beneficial for many reasons.
* It allows you to recreate your steps if you need to rerun your analysis many weeks, months or even years in the future. 
* It allows you to share your steps with other people.  If someone asks you what were the decisions made in the data analysis process, just hand them the script.
* Related to the above points, a script promotes transparency (here is what i did) and reproducibility (you can do it too). When you write code, you are forced to explicitly state the steps you took to do your research.   When you  do research by clicking through drop-down menus, your steps are lost, or at least documenting them requires considerable extra effort. 
2. If you make a mistake in a data analysis step, you can go back, change a few lines of code, and poof, you've fixed your problem.
3. It is more efficient. In particular, cleaning data can encompass a lot of tedious work that can be streamlined using statistical programming.

<br>

Hopefully, I've convinced you that statistical programming and R are worthwhile to learn.

## **Getting R**
\

R can be downloaded from one of the “CRAN” (Comprehensive R Archive Network) sites. In the US, the main site is at http://cran.us.r-project.org/.  Look in the “Download and Install R” area. Click on the appropriate link based on your operating system.  

**If you already have R on your computer, make sure you have the most updated version of R on your personal computer (4.0.3 "Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out").**


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Mac OS X**


1. On the “R for Mac OS X” page, there are multiple packages that could be downloaded. Click on the most recent version, which should be R-4.0.3.pkg as of January 2021; if you are running an earlier version of OS X, download the prior version of R listed below R-4.0.3.pkg based on your OS X.

2. After the package finishes downloading, locate the installer on your hard drive, double-click on the installer package, and after a few screens, select a destination for the installation of the R framework (the program) and the R.app GUI. Close the window when the installation is done.

3. An application will appear in the Applications folder: R.app. 

4. Browse to the [XQuartz download page](https://www.xquartz.org/). Click on the most recent version of XQuartz to download the application.

5. Run the XQuartz installer. XQuartz is needed to create windows to display many types of R graphics: this used to be included in MacOS until version 10.8 but now must be downloaded separately.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Windows**


1. On the “R for Windows” page, click on the “base” link, which should take you to the “R-4.0.3 for Windows (32/64 bit)” page.

2. On this page, click on either the “base” or “install R for the first time" links.

3. On the next page, click on the “Download R 4.0.3 for Windows” link, and save the exe file to your hard disk when prompted. Saving to the desktop is fine.

4. To begin the installation, double-click on the downloaded file. Don’t be alarmed if you get unknown publisher type warnings. Window’s User Account Control will also worry about an unidentified program wanting access to your computer. Click on “Run”.

5. Select the proposed options in each part of the install dialog. When the “Select Components” screen appears, just accept the standard choices.

Note: Depending on the age of your computer and version of Windows, you may be running either a “32-bit” or “64-bit” version of the Windows operating system. If you have the 64-bit version (most likely), R will install the appropriate version (R x64 3.5.2) and will also (for backwards compatibility) install the 32-bit version (R i386 3.5.2). You can run either, but you will probably just want to run the 64-bit version.



<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **What is RStudio?**
\

If you click on the R program you just downloaded, you will find a very basic user interface. For example, below is what I get on a Mac

<br>

<center>
![R's Interface.](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD 230/Lab/crd230.github.io/rint.png)
</center>

<br>

We will not use R's direct interface to run analyses. Instead, we will use the program RStudio. RStudio gives you a true integrated development environment (IDE), where you can write code in a window, see results in other windows, see locations of files, see objects you've created, and so on. To clarify which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Getting RStudio**
\

To download and install RStudio, follow the directions below

1. Navigate to RStudio's download [site](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
2. Click on the appropriate link based on your OS (Windows, Mac, Linux and many others). Do not download anything from the "Zip/Tarballs" section.
3. Click on the installer that you downloaded.  Follow the installation wizard's directions, making sure to keep all defaults intact.  After installation, RStudio should pop up in your Applications or Programs folder/menu.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **The RStudio Interface**
\

Open up RStudio.  You should see the interface shown in the figure below which has three windows.

<center>
![The RStudio Interface.](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD 230/Lab/crd230.github.io/rgui.png)

</center>

\


* **Console** (left) - The way R works is you write a line of code to execute some kind of task on a data object.  The R Console allows you to run code interactively. The screen prompt `>` is an invitation from R to enter its world. This is where you type code in, press enter to execute the code, and see the results.
* **Environment, History, and Connections tabs** (upper-right)
    + **Environment** - shows all the R objects that are currently open in your workspace.  This is the place, for example, where you will see any data you've loaded into R. When you exit RStudio, R will clear all objects in this window.  You can also click on ![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD 230/Lab/crd230.github.io/broom.png) to clear out all the objects loaded and created in your current session.
    + **History** - shows a list of executed commands in the current session.
    + **Connections** - you can connect to a variety of data sources, and explore the objects and data inside the connection.  I typically don't use this window, but you [can](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010915687-Using-RStudio-Connections).    
* **Files, Plots, Packages, Help and Viewer tabs** (lower-right)
    + **Files** - shows all the files and folders in your current working directory (more on what this means later).
    + **Plots** - shows any charts, graphs, maps and plots you've successfully executed.     
    + **Packages** - tells you all the R packages that you have access to (more on this later).
    + **Help** - shows help documentation for R commands that you've called up.  
    + **Viewer** - allows you to view local web content (won't be using this much).

There is actually fourth window. But, we'll get to this window a little later (if you read the [assignment guidelines](https://crd230.github.io/hw_guidelines.html) you already know what this fourth window is).


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **R Data Types**
\

Let's now explore what R can do. R is really just a big fancy calculator. For example, type in the following mathematical expression in the R console (left window)


```{r}
1+1
```

Note that spacing does not matter: `1+1` will generate the same answer as `1      +       1`.  Can you say hello to the world?
\


```{r error = TRUE}
hello world
```


Nope. What is the problem here?  We need to put quotes around it. 


```{r}
"hello world"
```


"hello world" is a character and R recognizes characters only if there are quotes around it. This brings us to the topic of basic data types in R.  There are four basic data types in R: character, logical, numeric, and factors (there are two others - complex and raw - but we won't cover them because they are rarely used). 


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Characters**
\

Characters are used to represent words or letters in R.  We saw this above with "hello world". Character values are also known as strings.  You might think that the value `"1"` is a number. Well, with quotes around, it isn't! Anything with quotes will be interpreted as a character.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Logicals**
\

A logical takes on two values: FALSE or TRUE. Logicals are usually constructed with comparison operators, which we'll go through more carefully in Lab 2.  Think of a logical as the answer to a question like "Is this value greater than (lower than/equal to) this other value?" The answer will be either TRUE or FALSE. TRUE and FALSE are logical values in R.  For example, typing in the following 


```{r}
3 > 2
```


Gives you a true. What about the following?


```{r}
"jacob" == "catherine"
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Numeric**
\

Numerics are separated into two types: integer and double.  The distinction between integers and doubles is usually not important. R treats numerics as doubles by default because it is a less restrictive data type.  You can do any mathematical operation on numeric values.  We added one and one above. We can also multiply using the `*` operator.


```{r}
2*3
```


Divide


```{r}
4/2
```


And even take the logarithm!


```{r}
log(1)
```


```{r}
log(0)
```


Uh oh. What is `-Inf`?  Well, you can't take the logarithm of 0, so R is telling you that you're getting a non numeric value in return.  The value `-Inf` is another type of value type that you can get in R.  


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Factors**
\

Think of a factor as a categorical variable.  It is sort of like a character, but not really. It is actually a numeric code with character-valued levels. Think of a character as a true string and a factor as a set of categories represented as characters. We won't use factors too much in this course.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **R Data Structures**
\
You just learned that R has four basic data types. Now, let's go through how we can store data in R. That is, you type in the character "hello world" or the number 3, and you want to store these values. You do this by using R's various data structures.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Vectors**
\

A vector is the most common and basic R data structure and is pretty much the workhorse of the language. A vector is simply a sequence of values which can be of any data type but all of the same type.  There are a number of ways to create a vector depending on the data type, but the most common is to insert the data you want to save in a vector into the command `c()`.  For example, to represent the values 4, 16 and 9 in a vector type in


```{r}
c(4, 16, 9)
```


You can also have a vector of character values


```{r}
c("jacob", "anne", "gwen")
```


The above code does not actually "save" the values 4, 16, and 9 - it just presents it on the screen in a vector. If you want to use these values again without having to type out `c(4, 16, 9)`, you can save it in a data object. You assign data to an object using the arrow sign `<-`.  This will create an object in R's memory that can be called back into the command window at any time.  For example, you can save "hello world" to a vector called *b* by typing in


```{r}
b <- "hello world"
b
```


You can pronounce the above as “b becomes 'hello world'”.

Note that R is case sensitive, if you type in *B* instead of *b*, you will get an error. You can save the numbers 4, 16 and 9 into a vector called *v1*


```{r}
v1 <- c(4, 16, 9)
v1
```


You should see the objects *b* and *v1* pop up in the Environment tab on the top right window of your RStudio interface.  


<center>
![Environment window](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD 230/Lab/crd230.github.io/lab0fig.png)

</center>


Note that the name *v1* is nothing special here. You could have named the object *x* or *crd230* or your pet's name (mine was *charlie*).  You can't, however, name objects using special characters (e.g. !, @, $) or only numbers (although you can combine numbers and letters, but a number cannot be at the beginning e.g. *2d2*).  For example, you'll get an error if you save the vector *c(4,16,9)* to an object with the following names


```{r error=TRUE}
123 <- c(4, 16, 9)
!!! <- c(4, 16, 9)
```



Also note that to distinguish a character value from a variable name, it needs to be quoted.  "v1" is a character value whereas *v1* is a variable.  One of the most common mistakes for beginners is to forget the quotes.


```{r error = TRUE}
brazil
```


The error occurs because R tries to print the value of object *brazil*, but there is no such variable. So remember that any time you get the error message `object 'something' not found`, the most likely reason is that you forgot to quote a character value. If not, it probably means that you have misspelled, or not yet created, the object that you are referring to.   I've included the common pitfalls and R tips in this class [resource](https://crd230.github.io/tips.html). 

Every vector has two key properties: *type* and *length*.  The type property indicates the data type that the vector is holding. Use the command `typeof()` to determine the type 


```{r}
typeof(b)
```


```{r}
typeof(v1)
```


Note that a vector cannot hold values of different types.  If different data types exist, R will coerce the values into the highest type based on its internal hierarchy:  logical < integer < double  < character.  Type in `test <- c("r", 6, TRUE)` in your R console.  What is the vector type of `test`?

The command `length()` determines the number of data values that the vector is storing


```{r}
length(b)
```


```{r}
length(v1)
```


You can also directly determine if a vector is of a specific data type by using the command `is.X()` where you replace `X` with the data type.  For example, to find out if *v1* is numeric, type in


```{r}
is.numeric(b)
```


```{r}
is.numeric(v1)
```


There is also `is.logical()`, `is.character()`, and `is.factor()`.  You can also coerce a vector of one data type to another.  For example, save the value "1" and "2" (both in quotes) into a vector named *x1*


```{r}
x1 <- c("1", "2")
typeof(x1)
```


To convert *x1* into a numeric, use the command `as.numeric()`


```{r}
x2 <- as.numeric(x1)
typeof(x2)
```


There is also `as.logical()`, `as.character()`, and `as.factor()`. 

An important practice you should adopt early is to keep only necessary objects in your current R Environment.  For example, we will not be using *x2* any longer in this guide.  To remove this object from R forever, use the command `rm()`


```{r eval = FALSE}
rm(x2)
```

The data frame object *x2* should have disappeared from the Environment tab. [Bye bye!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-KmOd3i7s)

Also note that when you close down R Studio, the objects you created above will disappear for good. Unless you save them onto your hard drive (we'll touch on saving data in Lab 2), all data objects you create in your current R session will go [bye bye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqfLVDIZcP8) when you exit the program.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Data Frames**
\

We learned that data values can be stored in data structures known as vectors.  The next step is to learn how to store vectors into an even higher level data structure.  The data frame can do this.   Data frames store vectors of the same length.  Create a vector called *v2* storing the values 5, 12, and 25


```{r}
v2 <- c(5,12,25)
```

We can create a data frame using the command `data.frame()` storing the vectors *v1* and *v2* as columns


```{r}
data.frame(v1, v2)
```


Store this data frame in an object called *df1*


```{r}
df1<-data.frame(v1, v2)
```

*df1* should pop up in your Environment window.  You'll notice a ![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD 230/Lab/crd230.github.io/lab0fig2.png) next to *df1*.  This tells you that *df1* possesses or holds more than one object. Click on ![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD 230/Lab/crd230.github.io/lab0fig2.png) and you'll see the two vectors we saved into *df1*.  Another neat thing you can do is directly click on *df1* from the Environment window to bring up an Excel style worksheet on the top left of your RStudio interface.  You can't edit this worksheet directly, but it allows you to see the values that a higher level R data object contains.

We can store different types of vectors in a data frame.  For example, we can store one character vector and one numeric vector in a single data frame.


```{r}
v3 <- c("jacob", "anne", "gwen")
df2 <- data.frame(v1, v3)
df2
```

For higher level data structures like a data frame, use the function `class()` to figure out what kind of object you're working with.


```{r}
class(df2)
```


We can't use `length()` on a data frame because it has more than one vector. Instead, it has *dimensions* - the number of rows and columns. You can find the number of rows and columns that a data frame has by using the command `dim()`


```{r}
dim(df1)
```


Here, the data frame *df1* has 3 rows and 2 columns. Data frames also have column names, which are characters.


```{r}
colnames(df1)
```


In this case, the data frame used the vector names for the column names. 

We can extract columns from data frames by referring to their names using the `$` sign.

```{r, error=TRUE}
df1$v1
```

We can also extra data from data frames using brackets `[ , ]`

```{r}
df1[,1]
```

The value before the comma indicates the row, which you leave empty if you are not selecting by row, which we did above.  The value after the comma indicates the column, which you leave empty if you are not selecting by column.  Let's select the 2nd row.

```{r, error=TRUE}
df1[2,]
```

What is the value in the 2nd row and 1st column?

```{r, error=TRUE}
df1[2,1]
```



<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Functions**
\

Let's take a step back and talk about functions (also known as commands).  An R function is a packaged recipe that converts one or more inputs (called arguments) into a single output. You execute all of your tasks in R using functions.  We have already used a couple of functions above including `typeof()` and `colnames()`. Every function in R will have the following basic format

`functionName(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)`

In R, you type in the function's name and set a number of options or parameters within parentheses that are separated by commas. Some options **need** to be set by the user - i.e. the function will spit out an error because a required option is blank - whereas others can be set but are not required because there is a default value established. 

Let’s use the function `seq()` which makes regular sequences of numbers.  You can find out what the options are for a function by calling up its help documentation by typing `?` and the function name


```{r eval = FALSE}
? seq
```

The help documentation should have popped up in the bottom right window of your RStudio interface.  The documentation should also provide some examples of the function at the bottom of the page. Type the arguments `from = 1, to = 10` inside the parentheses


```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10)
```


You should get the same result if you type in


```{r}
seq(1, 10)
```



The code above demonstrates something about how R resolves function arguments. When you use a function, you can always specify all the arguments in `arg = value` form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So in the code above, it is assumed that we want a sequence `from = 1` that goes `to = 10` because we typed 1 before 10. Type in 10 before 1 and see what happens.  Since we didn't specify step size, the default value of `by` in the function definition is used, which ends up being 1 in this case. 

Each argument requires a certain type of data type.  For example, you'll get an error when you use character values in `seq()`


```{r error = TRUE}
seq("p", "w")
```



<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Packages**
\

Functions do not exist in a vacuum, but exist within [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/intro.html).  Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. At the top left of a function's help documentation, you'll find in curly brackets the R package that the function is housed in.  For example, type in your console `? seq`. At the top right of the help documentation, you'll find that `seq()` is in the package **base**.  All the functions we have used so far are part of packages that have been pre-installed and pre-loaded into R. 

In order to use functions in a new package, you first need to install the package using the `install.packages()` command. For example, we will be using commands from the package **tidyverse** in this lab 


```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Next, you will need to load packages in your working environment (every time you start RStudio). We do this with the `library()` function.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

You should see a bunch of gobbledygook roll through your console screen.  Don't worry, that's just R downloading all of the other packages and applications that **tidyverse** relies on.  These are known as [dependencies](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html#dependencies).  Unless you get a message in red that indicates there is an error (like we saw when we typed in "hello world" without quotes), you should be fine.

The Packages window at the lower-right of your RStudio shows you all the packages you currently have installed.  If you don't have a package listed in this window, you'll need to use the `install.packages()` function to install it.  If the package is checked, that means it is loaded into your current R session 

For example, here is a section of my Packages window

<br>

![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD 230/Lab/crd230.github.io/window1.png)

</center>
\

<br>

The only packages loaded into my current session is **methods**, a package that is loaded every time you open an R session.  Let's say I use `install.packages()` to install the package **matrixStats**. The window now looks like

<br>

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD 230/Lab/crd230.github.io/window2.png)

</center>
\

When you load it in using `library()`, a check mark appears next to **matrixStats**

</center>
\

<br>

To uninstall a package, use the function `remove.packages()`.

**Note that you only need to install packages once (`install.pacakges()`), but you need to load them each time you relaunch RStudio (`library()`)**.  Repeat after me: Install once, library every time. Also note that R has several packages already preloaded into your working environment.  These are known as base packages and a list of their functions can be found [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html).

## **Tidyverse**
\

In most labs, we will be using commands from the **tidyverse** package. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of high-powered, consistent, and easy-to-use packages developed by a number of thoughtful and talented R developers.The consistency of the **tidyverse**, together with the goal of increasing productivity, mean that the syntax of tidy functions is typically straightforward to learn.  You can read more about **tidyverse** principles in Chapter 9, pages 147-151 in RDS.  


Excited about entering the **tidyverse**?  I bet you are, so here is a badge to wear with pride!

### **Tibbles**
\

Although the **tidyverse** works with all data objects, its fundamental object type is the tibble. Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviors to make life a little easier. There are two main differences in the usage of a data frame vs a tibble: printing and subsetting. Let's be clear here - tibbles are just a special kind of data frame. They just makes things a little "tidier." Let's bring in some data to illustrate the differences and similarities between data frames and tibbles.  Install the package **nycflights13** 


```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")  
```

Make sure you also load the package.


```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

There is a dataset called *flights* included in this package.  It includes information on all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013.  Let's save this file in the local R environment


```{r}
nyctib <- flights
class(nyctib)
```


This dataset is a tibble. Let's also save it as a regular data frame by using the `as.data.frame()` function


```{r}
nycdf <- as.data.frame(flights)
```

The first difference between data frames and tibbles is how the dataset looks.  Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and only the columns that fit on the screen.  In addition, each column reports its name and type.


```{r}
nyctib
```



Tibbles are designed so that you don't overwhelm your console when you print large data frames.  Compare the print output above to what you get with a data frame


```{r eval = FALSE}
nycdf
```

Ugly, right?  You can bring up the Excel like worksheet of the tibble (or data frame) using the `View()` function


```{r eval = FALSE}
View(nyctib)
```

You can identify the names of the columns (and hence the variables in the dataset) by using the function `names()`


```{r}
names(nyctib)
```


Finally, you can convert a regular data frame to a tibble using the `as_tibble()` function


```{r}
as_tibble(nycdf)
```


Not all functions work with tibbles, particularly those that are specific to spatial data. As such, we'll be using a combination of tibbles and regular data frames throughout the class, with a preference towards tibbles where possible.  Note that when you search on Google for how to do something in R, you will likely get non tidy ways of doing things.  Most of these suggestions are fine, but some are not and may screw you up down the road. My advice is to try to stick with tidy functions to do things in R. We'll learn more tidy functions in Lab 2.

Anyway, you earned another badge. Yes!

## **R Markdown**
\

In running the lines of code above, we’ve asked you to work directly in the R Console and issue commands in an interactive way. That is, you type a command after `>`, you hit enter/return, R responds, you type the next command, hit enter/return, R responds, and so on. Instead of writing the command directly into the console, you should write it in a script. The process is now: Type your command in the script. Run the code from the script. R responds. You get results. You can write two commands in a script. Run both simultaneously. R responds. You get results. This is the basic flow.

In your homework assignments, we will be asking you to submit code in a specific type of script: the R Markdown file. R Markdown allows you to create documents that serve as a neat record of your analysis. Think of it as a word document file, but instead of sentences in an essay, you are writing code for a data analysis.

When going through lab guides, I would recommend not copying and pasting code directly into the R Console, but saving and running it in an R Markdown file.  This will give you good practice in the R Markdown environment. Now is a good time to read through the class [assignment guidelines](https://crd230.github.io/hw_guidelines.html) as they go through the basics of R Markdown files. 

To open an R Markdown file, click on *File* at the top menu in RStudio, select *New File*, and then *R Markdown*. A window should pop up. In that window, for *title*, put in "Lab 1".  For *author*, put your name. Leave the HTML radio button clicked, and select OK.  A new R Markdown file should pop up in the top left window.

<br>

Don't change anything inside the YAML (the stuff at the top in between the `---`).  Also keep the grey chunk after the YAML.

````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
````

Delete everything else. Save this file (File -> Save) in an appropriate folder.  It's best to set up a clean and efficient file management structure as described in the [assignment guidelines](https://crd230.github.io/hw_guidelines.html).  For example, below is where I would save this file on my Mac laptop (I named the file "Lab 1").

Follow the directions in the [assignment guidelines](https://crd230.github.io/hw_guidelines.html) to add this lab's code in your Lab 1 R Markdown file.  Then knit it as an html, word or pdf file. You don't have to turn in the Rmd and its knitted file, but it's good practice to create an Rmd file for each lab.


Although the lab guides and course textbooks should get you through a lot of the functions that are needed to successfully accomplish tasks for this class, there are a number of useful online resources on R and RStudio that you can look into if you get stuck or want to learn more. We outline these resources [here](https://crd230.github.io/tips.html#Getting_help). If you ever get stuck, check this resource out first to troubleshoot before immediately asking a friend or the instructor.

## **Practice makes perfect**
\

Here are a few practice questions we'll answer together during  lab time.

1. Look up the help documentation for the function `rep()`. Use this function to create the following 3 vectors.

a. [1] 0 0 0 0 0
b. [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
c. [1] 4 5 5 6 6 6

2. Explain what is the problem in each line of code below. Fix the code so it will run properly. 

a. my variable <- 3
b. seq(1, 10 by = 2)
d. Library(cars)


3. Look up the help documentation for the function `cut()`. 

a. Describe the purpose of this function.  What kind of data type(s) does this function accept? Which arguments/options are required? Which arguments are not required and what are their default value(s)? 

b. Create an example vector and use the `cut()` function on it.  Explain your results.

4. Load the *mtcars* dataset by using the code `data(mtcars)`. Find the minimum, mean, median and maximum of the variable *mpg* in the *mtcars* dataset using just one line of code. We have not covered a function that does this yet, so the main point of this question is to get you used to using the resources you have available to find an answer.  Describe the process you used (searched online? use the class textbook?) to find the answer.
